# ICMTC-23-CTF-Finals-Crypto-Writeups
بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم

During ICMTC first season, my team Ng00m4lDhuhr and I got the first place الحمدلله, and I was the one responsible for the Crypto although my main category is Binary Exploitation (which was not present :( )

However, I addressed three challenges during the CTF, solving only one during its time (which was like 4.5 hours). Anyway, these are the writeups for 3 out 4 Crypto challenges in ICMTC 23 CTF Finals. At the time of composing these writeups, the Crypto instances were down so many info may not be available :( .

Hope you find them beneficial feel free to ping me for any comments <3 


with love from Ng00m4lDhuhr 💫❤️
